# Natural Language Query to SQL Converter Using Llama-2

This project aims to create a system that translates natural language queries (NLQs) into SQL queries using the Llama-2 model. The focus is on achieving syntax accuracy when the model is connected to a dataset.

## Project Overview

With the increasing need for data accessibility, the ability to query databases using natural language can significantly enhance user experience. This project leverages the Llama-2 model, a state-of-the-art language model, to convert NLQs into syntactically accurate SQL queries. This capability allows users, even without SQL knowledge, to interact with and retrieve information from databases efficiently.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Converts user-provided natural language queries into SQL statements.
- **Syntax Accuracy:** Ensures the generated SQL queries are syntactically correct.
- **Dataset Integration:** Connects to a specified dataset to tailor SQL query generation based on the schema and data.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook:** Provides an interactive environment to test and refine the model.

## Detailed Explanation

### Model Training and Fine-Tuning

The Llama-2 model used in this project has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. Depending on the complexity of the queries and the specific database schema, further fine-tuning might be necessary to improve accuracy. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to better understand the nuances of the target language (SQL in this case).

### Handling Schema-Specific Queries

To ensure the generated SQL queries are relevant and accurate, the model needs to understand the schema of the connected database. This can be achieved by providing the model with metadata about the database tables, columns, and relationships during the fine-tuning process.

### Error Handling and Validation

The system should include mechanisms to handle and correct errors in the generated SQL queries. This can involve:

- **Syntax Checking:** Automatically checking the syntax of generated queries before execution.
- **Query Validation:** Validating the logic of the queries to ensure they align with user intent.
- **Interactive Corrections:** Allowing users to manually correct and refine the generated queries.

## Future Enhancements

- **Contextual Understanding:** Improving the model's ability to understand context and generate more complex SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Natural Language Feedback:** Allowing users to provide natural language feedback to iteratively improve query accuracy.
- **User Interface:** Developing a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to interact with the system without needing to access the notebook directly.
